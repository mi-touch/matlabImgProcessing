Dential images detection and feature extraction The objective of the research reported here is to automate the process of forensic dentistry.In forensic dentistry, the postmortem (PM) dental record is compared against antemortem (AM) records pertaining to some presumed features. A manual comparison between the AM and PM records is based on a systematic dental chart and X-ray radiograph as the dataset. A number of distinctive features are noted for each individual tooth. These features include properties of the teeth(e.g., toothpresent/not present, crown and root morphology, pathology and dental restorations), periodontal tissue features, and anatomical features. The process for the objective of this work consist of load images, detect features, Extract features and show matched features
